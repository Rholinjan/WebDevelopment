	<h1>My hobby is playing chess</h1>

	<ul>
		
		<h2>1.When do I start playing chess?</h2>
		<p>I start playing chess when I'm a grade 6 student of San Roque Navotas City.</p>
		<h2>2.Who taught me playing chess?</h2>
		<p>No one taught me to play chess because of the app game on the phone. I started to play even though I didn't know exactly how to play. After becoming familiar with all the pieces, I started to play with my mother. She is the one who helped me become familiar with some openings and efficient moves like the 4-move checkmate.</p>
		<h2>3.My buddies in playing chess</h2>
		<p>Guess what, my playing buddy in chess now is my little brother, who is only in grade 1. He always watches me play chess, so just like me, no one taught him how to play. Our uncle is the one who taught him to become familiar with the proper way and be more aware of the board.</p>
		<h2>4.What is your favorite chess piece?</h2>
		<p>My favorite chess piece is the pawn. For others, they only see the pawn as weak, slow, and useless, but for me, the pawn is the most important piece in the game, except for the king, of course. The pawn is slow but keeps moving forward, and it is not useless because the pawn often sacrifices so that other pieces can survive. The longer the game goes on, the more important the pawn becomes because you can promote them into the pieces you want and need.</p>
		<h2>5.Quotes about chess</h2>
		<p>Love is like playing chess: one wrong move, and you've lost your queen. However, that's not the end. Always remember the game ends when the king falls, not when a pawn takes the queen.</p>
